## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is James Larson (he/him). I am a PhD student in the Department of Atmospheric Science at Colorado State University. I'm interested in societal-climate interactions and how they can be represented in models. Prior to this project, during my masterâ€™s degree, I explored how ocean currents leave their signature on climate variability, particularly in high-resolution reanalyses and climate models. Outside of research, I am involved in community-based solutions to food insecurity. Please feel welcome to reach out with any questions and inquiries to collaborate!
